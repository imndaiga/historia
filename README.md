# MIMINANI
## An Introduction

**MIMINANI** is a genealogical mapper that computatively charts out a users lineage. It is currently a personal, but openly developed project that I started in late 2016. Inspired by my own need to trace my roots as far back and out as I could, I found myself disappointed by available methods to automate the data collection, computation and representation. Which then led me to first design then develop this web service.

MIMINANI is a Kiswahili portmanteau of two words, **_"Mimi Nani?"_** A question that means **_"Who Am I?"_**

## Usage
Usage will be dictated by the chosen user interface. Currently, this app is designed to run as a RESTful web service written in Python and developed under Python's Flask web framework. There are two user interfaces I'm currently focussing on (in order of execution):
- Browser-based web app (using KnockoutJS and Bootstrap frameworks)
- Interactive E-mail service

Details for each usage case will be provided as soon as I get them functional.

## Changelog
v0 - Database models based on graph nodes and edges.
